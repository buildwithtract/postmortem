            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Between May 2023 and March 2025, Tract attempted to build a
              venture-backed company to address Britain’s housing crisis by
              improving the planning permission process. After raising a
              £744,000 pre-seed round in April 2024, we explored several
              business models: a site-sourcing tool for developers (Tract
              Source), a free land-appraisal tool for landowners (Attract),
              becoming tech-enabled land promoters ourselves, and finally, an
              AI-powered platform to assist with drafting planning documents
              (Tract Editor).
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite significant technical progress, building tools like Scout
              and the well-received Tract Editor, our journey taught us critical
              lessons from failing to secure a viable, venture-scale business
              model in the British property market. We learned the difficulty of
              selling software into a conservative sector, experienced the
              operational complexities and timelines of land promotion, and
              encountered a low willingness to pay for useful tools.
              Furthermore, we came to understand how the market's conservatism
              and fragmentation limited its potential for venture-backed
              disruption. After nearly two years without revenue or committed
              paying customers, we realised we lacked a clear path to the
              necessary scale and returns. This prompted the decision to cease
              operations and return capital, sharing our experience as a case
              study.
            </p>
            <p>
              In retrospect, it's easy to see ways we could have approached
              things differently. This document is a post mortem, explaining
              what happened and why it went wrong. Our aim in writing this is:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Codify and share what we’ve learned for our benefit and
                hopefully others.
              </li>
              <li>Document the story for posterity.</li>
              <li>
                Produce an artifact to explain, if not justify, the time and
                money spent.
              </li>
              <li>Exorcise our demons.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              We want to stress from the start that the ultimate failure of the
              company lies with us. Some issues were within our control and some
              were beyond it. At times, we’ll describe external factors in ways
              that sound negative. This isn’t an attempt to pass blame. We want
              to tell the story as matter-of-factly as possible. Most
              importantly, we’re extremely grateful to everyone who supported us
              over the last couple of years, in money and in time.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Housing in Britain is expensive because getting planning
                permission is difficult.
              </li>
              <li>
                Granting permission takes the median hectare of land from
                £20,000 to £2.4 million - a 139x uplift.
              </li>
              <li>
                If we can reduce the costs and uncertainty of this process by
                any reasonable amount, we can build a business and help solve
                the housing crisis.

                Many young people have had to delay forming families and often
                take poorly paid, insecure jobs that can barely cover rent and
                living costs as the price for living in culturally attractive
                cities. They see opportunity as limited and growth as barely
                perceptible. Meanwhile, older generations sit on housing
                property worth many times what they paid and, stuck in a
                zero-sum mindset, often prioritise the protection of their own
                neighbourhoods over the need to build more homes. Can you blame
                young people who resent older people, and the West’s economic
                system itself, when this is what it offers them?

            <p>
              Housing in Britain is expensive because of artificial supply
              constraints - specifically, the difficulty of obtaining planning
              permission to build more. Planning permission is Britain’s
              regulatory approval that landowners must secure before developing
              land or changing a building's use. When permission is granted to
              build homes on agricultural land, its value increases dramatically
              (often 140x or more), creating enormous wealth for landowners.
            </p>

            <p>
              This looked like a business opportunity: if we could help more
              sites get planning permission, we could capture some of that
              uplift. The market size looked compelling - billions in Britain
              alone, the political winds seemed favourable, and there seemed to
              be few modern software solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
              We were driven by a mix of moral outrage and technological
              optimism. It seemed absurd that bureaucratic obstacles were
              holding back so much potential value, especially when millions
              were being spent on documentation that could be automated. With
              the rise of LLMs, we believed we could transform this inefficient
              process.

              Tract Source (May 2023 - October 2023)
            </h3>
            <p>
              Strategic land teams are groups within property development
              companies responsible for identifying and acquiring land with
              long-term development potential. They focus on finding sites that
              don’t yet have permission for development but possess
              characteristics that suggest it could be obtained in the future.
              The earlier they can identify and secure control of these sites,
              the greater their competitive advantage and profit potential.
            </p>
            <p>
              This felt like a software-shaped problem and could form the basis
              of a larger platform for planning, moving elsewhere along the
              value chain. When Jamie began working on Tract, this site sourcing
              problem was the first thing he looked at.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some sourcing tools existed, but the popular options seemed poorly
              built: badly designed, built atop untrustworthy data sources, and
              not built around the sourcing workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jamie had ideas to improve the product experience and began
              building them out. He started to lean on industry advisors for
              introductions. He read <em>The Mom Test</em> (more on which later)
              and had dozens of calls with whoever would take them.
            </p>
            <p>
              During these calls, he realised his intuitions about the existing
              products’ problems were correct (“I don’t trust it”, “I need to
              check the numbers, it’s annoying”). This was exciting: he thought
              he was onto something.
            </p>
            <p>
              But he didn’t ask why users tolerated it (“It’s fine”, “Does what
              I need”, “We went with [competitor] because, to be honest, they’re
              nice guys”). It was unlikely whatever he built could be 10-100x
              better at solving this problem without radically changing their
              workflow, which was tough for a solo developer working on savings
              – Henry began helping in his free time from late summer but
              wouldn’t come on full time until mid-December.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jamie also began to find <em>more</em> competitors, some
              well-resourced, all of whom appeared to be competing on price.
              These were already cheap contracts: a few hundred pounds per month
              for a small/medium-sized team. And they were getting cheaper.
            </p>
            <p>
              We concluded that this was a difficult market to sell into, with
              race-to-the-bottom pricing dynamics, and no obvious way to make a
              SaaS tool that helped strategic land teams do site selection so
              well that these factors wouldn’t matter. It was time to pivot.
            </p>

            <h4 id="timeline-tract-source-learnings">Learnings</h4>
            <p>This process gave us:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                a better understanding of the problem space and competitive
                environment;
              </li>
              <li>the basis of a network;</li>
              <li>
                and time in which the early data infrastructure which would
                support our subsequent products was built.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              However, it took <strong>too long</strong> to reach the pivot
              point. A more thorough competitor analysis would have revealed the
              market problems earlier, rather than being distracted by writing
              code. None of what we needed to learn required writing code to get
              there.
            </p>
            <p>
              The biggest lesson here:

                >getting time-to-validation as low as possible matters more than

              Interlude: Attract (October 2023 - November 2023)
            </h3>
            <p>
              Our site appraisal tool, Attract, emerged from discussions with
              our design partner Paul and from Tract Source's challenges. The
              concept was simple but promising: instead of selling land
              information to developers, we’d provide it to landowners for free.
              The greatest constraint for any promoter or developer is access to
              developable land, so we imagined a tool encouraging landowners to
              reveal their openness to development would be valuable. The
              generated appraisals would allow us to rapidly qualify sites and
              identify potential opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially, we considered selling this tool to developers and land
              promoters seeking strategic land opportunities. However, we
              quickly recognised two fatal flaws in this approach:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The economics didn't work—we couldn't charge more than
                £50/month/customer, and there weren’t many customers.
              </li>
              <li>
                We'd face the same sales challenges as Tract Source, compounded
                by the fact that this was an unconventional solution with no
                market precedents.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Despite this, Jamie completed the conversion work and launched a
              white-labelled version on Paul’s company’s website in early
              November. It delivered impressive results: he received more
              submissions and higher-quality leads. This quick win validated our
              technical approach, but the underlying business model remained
              insufficient to build our company.
            </p>
            <p>
              This experience taught us something valuable: we could create
              genuinely useful tools that solved real problems. However, we
              still hadn't cracked how to transform that utility into a
              venture-scale business model.

            <p>
              With the white-labelled version of Attract online, we entered a
              period of exploration and uncertainty. We had a call with a major
              surveyor where we showed them a mocked-up tool for writing a
              planning application using an LLM and the information about a site
              in our database. But after the demo, we were ghosted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Market concerns loomed large. The pricing dynamics made us
              question our ability to raise capital with our current approach.
              In retrospect, we may have been closer to viable products than we
              realised. Multiple British prop-tech companies have been funded,
              including in the US, during the lifetime, suggesting alternative
              paths we could have taken.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite challenges, we continued experimenting. In December, we
              created a ‘Tinder for Buildings’ demo with inpainting models that
              received positive feedback. We continued scoping ways to build a
              business on our planning data work. We were awarded an

                <strong>JR:</strong> At this stage, we were clearly concerned
                about the market, but I don’t think we did enough – now or
                indeed later – to precisify those concerns. We gave up on the
                platform idea because of a couple of crappy meetings, rather
                than work out how to pitch better. It feels like we weren’t
                trying hard enough to be an organisation that learned from its
                mistakes.

            <h3 id="timeline-jan-2024-may-2024">January 2024 - May 2024</h3>
            <p>
              In January, we began fundraising while working on extracting Local
              Planning Authority validation checklists—technical work to support
              our evolving vision.
            </p>
            <p>
              A February visit to a developer proved illuminating, though not as
              hoped. Their skeptical in-house planner admitted: "To be honest,
              the system being broken helps us." This comment crystallised a
              tension in our market: many established players benefited from the
              inefficiencies we aimed to solve.
            </p>
            <p>
              This realisation prompted us to revisit our fundamental problem
              statement. The facts were compelling: land with planning
              permission becomes dramatically more valuable, and this value
              creation stems from the friction and uncertainty in the planning
              process—friction that good software could reduce.
            </p>
            <p>
              We faced a dilemma. Selling software into this market would be
              tough, and it seemed wasteful to capture only a small slice of the
              value we could create. If we could facilitate 100x value increases
              in land, why sell this capability to others for modest SaaS fees?
              What B2B model could compete with capturing that uplift directly?
            </p>
            <p>
              We considered a radical pivot: becoming land promoters ourselves.
              We’d partner with landowners or acquire land, secure planning
              permission using our technology, and sell with permission
              granted—capturing the value uplift directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              We found another opportunity: promotion costs don't scale linearly
              with site size, making many smaller sites economically unviable
              for traditional promoters. We could counterposition by targeting
              these ignored sites and sell them to SME developers.
            </p>
            <p>This model offered significant advantages:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>We avoided selling software to a resistant market.</li>
              <li>
                The potential revenue and profit margins were substantial,
                especially if we could reduce costs through automation.
              </li>
              <li>
                We had a clear technological roadmap: automate the existing site
                selection and planning application processes.
              </li>
              <li>
                As our own customer, we could optimise an industry that
                underutilised modern technology.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Implementation would be challenging—some aspects like site visits
              couldn't be fully automated—but we believed we could create a
              durable advantage by controlling the critical fulcrum point where
              planning permission is granted.
            </p>
            <p>This became our fundraising narrative:</p>

                </figcaption>
              </a>
            </figure>

            <p>
              During the fundraising process however, we identified a
              bottleneck: access to land. Without reliable land access, our
              growth would be constrained. How would we:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>put ourselves in front of landowners,</li>
              <li>identify the ones open to selling,</li>
              <li>get them over the line?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              One investor – who ultimately passed – described this challenge as
              requiring extensive "hand-cranking"—an apt analogy. But at the
              time, we thought Attract could solve our top of funnel problem.
            </p>

            <p>
              Rather than white-labelling the tool for strategic land teams, we
              could own it, market aggressively to landowners, keep the sites we
              want to develop ourselves and pass the rest to strategic land
              teams for a referral fee. Appraising land and advising on its
              development potential is part of what a land agent does. We would
              be automating that.
            </p>

            <p>
              Why would a landowner use our tool? Partly out of curiosity like
              taking personality quizzes, but also because our information was
              genuinely useful. Land agents bill hundreds of pounds for
              appraisals with the same information we could pull
              programmatically. Henry had recently commissioned two appraisals
              for sites following advice his family had received. They were £600
              each and contained:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                A summary of planning constraints for the site (e.g.
                conservation areas, nearby listed buildings, where the village
                sat in the settlement hierarchy).
              </li>
              <li>
                Relevant local plan policies (e.g. what development to
                encourage/discourage).
              </li>
              <li>Previous planning applications for the site.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              We already had this information or plans to collect it. We could
              generate these appraisals, give them to landowners for free, and
              use this to solve the top-of-the-funnel problem.
            </p>

            <p>
              We made a subtle but critical error here - we assumed the problem
              was limited to the top of our funnel (identifying landowners and
              sites). In reality, as we'd discover, no part of the funnel was
              robust enough to build a venture-scale business in our required
              timeframe.
            </p>

            <p>
              Had we recognised this earlier, we might have concluded this
              business lacked venture-scale potential, or we could have examined
              how to modify our approach.

                <strong>JR:</strong> We could have done more with this insight
                if we had been more operationally effective. We could have done
                our own site-search process, generated appraisals for sites we
                liked, printed them out, and mailed them to the landowners.
                (This wouldn’t have solved the venture-scale problem, but I’m
                not sure we gave this horse enough of a flogging before calling
                it dead.)

              Paul Graham has an essay where he says the most efficient question
              to ask founders is “What have you learnt from users?”. One problem
              this question would have exposed if we’d asked it was that we
              hadn’t spoken to the people using Attract and who would develop
              their land with us. The people we were speaking to and learning
              about planning and development from weren’t our actual users. This
              meant we couldn’t begin testing our product’s commercial traction
              by asking if a user would pay for it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although we erred by not getting relevant user feedback while we
              had months of savings, the focus in the latter part of the raise
              to build a business plan was probably correct. We were working on
              Tract unpaid. As the deadline to raise money approached, our focus
              was (not unreasonably) on getting the funding to survive.
            </p>
            <p>
              These weeks were a success: we raised capital in a tough situation
              when the alternative was to shut down and get jobs. However, we
              had backed ourselves into a corner, not taking advantage of the
              previous time to run a rigorous market and product-discovery
              process.
