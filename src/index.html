            <p>
              Between May 2023 and March 2025, Tract attempted to build a
              venture-backed company to address Britain’s housing crisis by
              improving the planning permission process. After raising a
              £744,000 pre-seed round in April 2024, we explored several
              business models: a site-sourcing tool for developers (Tract
              Source), a free land-appraisal tool for landowners (Attract),
              becoming tech-enabled land promoters ourselves, and finally, an
              AI-powered platform to assist with drafting planning documents
              (Tract Editor).
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite significant technical progress, building tools like Scout
              and the well-received Tract Editor, our journey taught us critical
              lessons from failing to secure a viable, venture-scale business
              model in the British property market. We learned the difficulty of
              selling software into a conservative sector, experienced the
              operational complexities and timelines of land promotion, and
              encountered a low willingness to pay for useful tools.
              Furthermore, we came to understand how the market's conservatism
              and fragmentation limited its potential for venture-backed
              disruption. After nearly two years without revenue or committed
              paying customers, we realised we lacked a clear path to the
              necessary scale and returns. This prompted the decision to cease
              operations and return capital, sharing our experience as a case
              study.
            </p>
            <p>
              In retrospect, it's easy to see ways we could have approached
              things differently. This document is a post mortem, explaining
              what happened and why it went wrong. Our aim in writing this is:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Codify and share what we’ve learned for our benefit and
                hopefully others.
              </li>
              <li>Document the story for posterity.</li>
              <li>
                Produce an artifact to explain, if not justify, the time and
                money spent.
              </li>
              <li>Exorcise our demons.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              We want to stress from the start that the ultimate failure of the
              company lies with us. Some issues were within our control and some
              were beyond it. At times, we’ll describe external factors in ways
              that sound negative. This isn’t an attempt to pass blame. We want
              to tell the story as matter-of-factly as possible. Most
              importantly, we’re extremely grateful to everyone who supported us
              over the last couple of years, in money and in time.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Housing in Britain is expensive because getting planning
                permission is difficult.
              </li>
              <li>
                Granting permission takes the median hectare of land from
                £20,000 to £2.4 million - a 139x uplift.
              </li>
              <li>
                If we can reduce the costs and uncertainty of this process by
                any reasonable amount, we can build a business and help solve
                the housing crisis.

              <p>
                Many young people have had to delay forming families and often
                take poorly paid, insecure jobs that can barely cover rent and
                living costs as the price for living in culturally attractive
                cities. They see opportunity as limited and growth as barely
                perceptible. Meanwhile, older generations sit on housing
                property worth many times what they paid and, stuck in a
                zero-sum mindset, often prioritise the protection of their own
                neighbourhoods over the need to build more homes. Can you blame
                young people who resent older people, and the West’s economic
                system itself, when this is what it offers them?

            <p>
              Housing in Britain is expensive because of artificial supply
              constraints - specifically, the difficulty of obtaining planning
              permission to build more. Planning permission is Britain’s
              regulatory approval that landowners must secure before developing
              land or changing a building's use. When permission is granted to
              build homes on agricultural land, its value increases dramatically
              (often 140x or more), creating enormous wealth for landowners.
            </p>

            <p>
              This looked like a business opportunity: if we could help more
              sites get planning permission, we could capture some of that
              uplift. The market size looked compelling - billions in Britain
              alone, the political winds seemed favourable, and there seemed to
              be few modern software solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
              We were driven by a mix of moral outrage and technological
              optimism. It seemed absurd that bureaucratic obstacles were
              holding back so much potential value, especially when millions
              were being spent on documentation that could be automated. With
              the rise of LLMs, we believed we could transform this inefficient
              process.
