            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Between May 2023 and March 2025, Tract attempted to build a
              venture-backed company to address Britain’s housing crisis by
              improving the planning permission process. After raising a
              £744,000 pre-seed round in April 2024, we explored several
              business models: a site-sourcing tool for developers (Tract
              Source), a free land-appraisal tool for landowners (Attract),
              becoming tech-enabled land promoters ourselves, and finally, an
              AI-powered platform to assist with drafting planning documents
              (Tract Editor).
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite significant technical progress, building tools like Scout
              and the well-received Tract Editor, our journey taught us critical
              lessons from failing to secure a viable, venture-scale business
              model in the British property market. We learned the difficulty of
              selling software into a conservative sector, experienced the
              operational complexities and timelines of land promotion, and
              encountered a low willingness to pay for useful tools.
              Furthermore, we came to understand how the market's conservatism
              and fragmentation limited its potential for venture-backed
              disruption. After nearly two years without revenue or committed
              paying customers, we realised we lacked a clear path to the
              necessary scale and returns. This prompted the decision to cease
              operations and return capital, sharing our experience as a case
              study.
            </p>
            <p>
              In retrospect, it's easy to see ways we could have approached
              things differently. This document is a post mortem, explaining
              what happened and why it went wrong. Our aim in writing this is:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Codify and share what we’ve learned for our benefit and
                hopefully others.
              </li>
              <li>Document the story for posterity.</li>
              <li>
                Produce an artifact to explain, if not justify, the time and
                money spent.
              </li>
              <li>Exorcise our demons.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              We want to stress from the start that the ultimate failure of the
              company lies with us. Some issues were within our control and some
              were beyond it. At times, we’ll describe external factors in ways
              that sound negative. This isn’t an attempt to pass blame. We want
              to tell the story as matter-of-factly as possible. Most
              importantly, we’re extremely grateful to everyone who supported us
              over the last couple of years, in money and in time.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Housing in Britain is expensive because getting planning
                permission is difficult.
              </li>
              <li>
                Granting permission takes the median hectare of land from
                £20,000 to £2.4 million - a 139x uplift.
              </li>
              <li>
                If we can reduce the costs and uncertainty of this process by
                any reasonable amount, we can build a business and help solve
                the housing crisis.

                Many young people have had to delay forming families and often
                take poorly paid, insecure jobs that can barely cover rent and
                living costs as the price for living in culturally attractive
                cities. They see opportunity as limited and growth as barely
                perceptible. Meanwhile, older generations sit on housing
                property worth many times what they paid and, stuck in a
                zero-sum mindset, often prioritise the protection of their own
                neighbourhoods over the need to build more homes. Can you blame
                young people who resent older people, and the West’s economic
                system itself, when this is what it offers them?

            <p>
              Housing in Britain is expensive because of artificial supply
              constraints - specifically, the difficulty of obtaining planning
              permission to build more. Planning permission is Britain’s
              regulatory approval that landowners must secure before developing
              land or changing a building's use. When permission is granted to
              build homes on agricultural land, its value increases dramatically
              (often 140x or more), creating enormous wealth for landowners.
            </p>

            <p>
              This looked like a business opportunity: if we could help more
              sites get planning permission, we could capture some of that
              uplift. The market size looked compelling - billions in Britain
              alone, the political winds seemed favourable, and there seemed to
              be few modern software solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
              We were driven by a mix of moral outrage and technological
              optimism. It seemed absurd that bureaucratic obstacles were
              holding back so much potential value, especially when millions
              were being spent on documentation that could be automated. With
              the rise of LLMs, we believed we could transform this inefficient
              process.

              Tract Source (May 2023 - October 2023)
            </h3>
            <p>
              Strategic land teams are groups within property development
              companies responsible for identifying and acquiring land with
              long-term development potential. They focus on finding sites that
              don’t yet have permission for development but possess
              characteristics that suggest it could be obtained in the future.
              The earlier they can identify and secure control of these sites,
              the greater their competitive advantage and profit potential.
            </p>
            <p>
              This felt like a software-shaped problem and could form the basis
              of a larger platform for planning, moving elsewhere along the
              value chain. When Jamie began working on Tract, this site sourcing
              problem was the first thing he looked at.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some sourcing tools existed, but the popular options seemed poorly
              built: badly designed, built atop untrustworthy data sources, and
              not built around the sourcing workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jamie had ideas to improve the product experience and began
              building them out. He started to lean on industry advisors for
              introductions. He read <em>The Mom Test</em> (more on which later)
              and had dozens of calls with whoever would take them.
            </p>
            <p>
              During these calls, he realised his intuitions about the existing
              products’ problems were correct (“I don’t trust it”, “I need to
              check the numbers, it’s annoying”). This was exciting: he thought
              he was onto something.
            </p>
            <p>
              But he didn’t ask why users tolerated it (“It’s fine”, “Does what
              I need”, “We went with [competitor] because, to be honest, they’re
              nice guys”). It was unlikely whatever he built could be 10-100x
              better at solving this problem without radically changing their
              workflow, which was tough for a solo developer working on savings
              – Henry began helping in his free time from late summer but
              wouldn’t come on full time until mid-December.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jamie also began to find <em>more</em> competitors, some
              well-resourced, all of whom appeared to be competing on price.
              These were already cheap contracts: a few hundred pounds per month
              for a small/medium-sized team. And they were getting cheaper.
            </p>
            <p>
              We concluded that this was a difficult market to sell into, with
              race-to-the-bottom pricing dynamics, and no obvious way to make a
              SaaS tool that helped strategic land teams do site selection so
              well that these factors wouldn’t matter. It was time to pivot.
            </p>

            <h4 id="timeline-tract-source-learnings">Learnings</h4>
            <p>This process gave us:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                a better understanding of the problem space and competitive
                environment;
              </li>
              <li>the basis of a network;</li>
              <li>
                and time in which the early data infrastructure which would
                support our subsequent products was built.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              However, it took <strong>too long</strong> to reach the pivot
              point. A more thorough competitor analysis would have revealed the
              market problems earlier, rather than being distracted by writing
              code. None of what we needed to learn required writing code to get
              there.
            </p>
            <p>
              The biggest lesson here:

                >getting time-to-validation as low as possible matters more than

              Interlude: Attract (October 2023 - November 2023)
            </h3>
            <p>
              Our site appraisal tool, Attract, emerged from discussions with
              our design partner Paul and from Tract Source's challenges. The
              concept was simple but promising: instead of selling land
              information to developers, we’d provide it to landowners for free.
              The greatest constraint for any promoter or developer is access to
              developable land, so we imagined a tool encouraging landowners to
              reveal their openness to development would be valuable. The
              generated appraisals would allow us to rapidly qualify sites and
              identify potential opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially, we considered selling this tool to developers and land
              promoters seeking strategic land opportunities. However, we
              quickly recognised two fatal flaws in this approach:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The economics didn't work—we couldn't charge more than
                £50/month/customer, and there weren’t many customers.
              </li>
              <li>
                We'd face the same sales challenges as Tract Source, compounded
                by the fact that this was an unconventional solution with no
                market precedents.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Despite this, Jamie completed the conversion work and launched a
              white-labelled version on Paul’s company’s website in early
              November. It delivered impressive results: he received more
              submissions and higher-quality leads. This quick win validated our
              technical approach, but the underlying business model remained
              insufficient to build our company.
            </p>
            <p>
              This experience taught us something valuable: we could create
              genuinely useful tools that solved real problems. However, we
              still hadn't cracked how to transform that utility into a
              venture-scale business model.

            <p>
              With the white-labelled version of Attract online, we entered a
              period of exploration and uncertainty. We had a call with a major
              surveyor where we showed them a mocked-up tool for writing a
              planning application using an LLM and the information about a site
              in our database. But after the demo, we were ghosted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Market concerns loomed large. The pricing dynamics made us
              question our ability to raise capital with our current approach.
              In retrospect, we may have been closer to viable products than we
              realised. Multiple British prop-tech companies have been funded,
              including in the US, during the lifetime, suggesting alternative
              paths we could have taken.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite challenges, we continued experimenting. In December, we
              created a ‘Tinder for Buildings’ demo with inpainting models that
              received positive feedback. We continued scoping ways to build a
              business on our planning data work. We were awarded an

                about the market, but I don’t think we did enough – now or
                indeed later – to precisify those concerns. We gave up on the
                platform idea because of a couple of crappy meetings, rather
                than work out how to pitch better. It feels like we weren’t

            <h3 id="timeline-jan-2024-may-2024">January 2024 - May 2024</h3>
            <p>
              In January, we began fundraising while working on extracting Local
              Planning Authority validation checklists—technical work to support
              our evolving vision.
            </p>
            <p>
              A February visit to a developer proved illuminating, though not as
              hoped. Their skeptical in-house planner admitted: "To be honest,
              the system being broken helps us." This comment crystallised a
              tension in our market: many established players benefited from the
              inefficiencies we aimed to solve.
            </p>
            <p>
              This realisation prompted us to revisit our fundamental problem
              statement. The facts were compelling: land with planning
              permission becomes dramatically more valuable, and this value
              creation stems from the friction and uncertainty in the planning
              process—friction that good software could reduce.
            </p>
            <p>
              We faced a dilemma. Selling software into this market would be
              tough, and it seemed wasteful to capture only a small slice of the
              value we could create. If we could facilitate 100x value increases
              in land, why sell this capability to others for modest SaaS fees?
              What B2B model could compete with capturing that uplift directly?
            </p>
            <p>
              We considered a radical pivot: becoming land promoters ourselves.
              We’d partner with landowners or acquire land, secure planning
              permission using our technology, and sell with permission
              granted—capturing the value uplift directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              We found another opportunity: promotion costs don't scale linearly
              with site size, making many smaller sites economically unviable
              for traditional promoters. We could counterposition by targeting
              these ignored sites and sell them to SME developers.
            </p>
            <p>This model offered significant advantages:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>We avoided selling software to a resistant market.</li>
              <li>
                The potential revenue and profit margins were substantial,
                especially if we could reduce costs through automation.
              </li>
              <li>
                We had a clear technological roadmap: automate the existing site
                selection and planning application processes.
              </li>
              <li>
                As our own customer, we could optimise an industry that
                underutilised modern technology.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Implementation would be challenging—some aspects like site visits
              couldn't be fully automated—but we believed we could create a
              durable advantage by controlling the critical fulcrum point where
              planning permission is granted.
            </p>
            <p>This became our fundraising narrative:</p>

                </figcaption>
              </a>
            </figure>

            <p>
              During the fundraising process however, we identified a
              bottleneck: access to land. Without reliable land access, our
              growth would be constrained. How would we:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>put ourselves in front of landowners,</li>
              <li>identify the ones open to selling,</li>
              <li>get them over the line?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              One investor – who ultimately passed – described this challenge as
              requiring extensive "hand-cranking"—an apt analogy. But at the
              time, we thought Attract could solve our top of funnel problem.
            </p>

            <p>
              Rather than white-labelling the tool for strategic land teams, we
              could own it, market aggressively to landowners, keep the sites we
              want to develop ourselves and pass the rest to strategic land
              teams for a referral fee. Appraising land and advising on its
              development potential is part of what a land agent does. We would
              be automating that.
            </p>

            <p>
              Why would a landowner use our tool? Partly out of curiosity like
              taking personality quizzes, but also because our information was
              genuinely useful. Land agents bill hundreds of pounds for
              appraisals with the same information we could pull
              programmatically. Henry had recently commissioned two appraisals
              for sites following advice his family had received. They were £600
              each and contained:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                A summary of planning constraints for the site (e.g.
                conservation areas, nearby listed buildings, where the village
                sat in the settlement hierarchy).
              </li>
              <li>
                Relevant local plan policies (e.g. what development to
                encourage/discourage).
              </li>
              <li>Previous planning applications for the site.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              We already had this information or plans to collect it. We could
              generate these appraisals, give them to landowners for free, and
              use this to solve the top-of-the-funnel problem.
            </p>

            <p>
              We made a subtle but critical error here - we assumed the problem
              was limited to the top of our funnel (identifying landowners and
              sites). In reality, as we'd discover, no part of the funnel was
              robust enough to build a venture-scale business in our required
              timeframe.
            </p>

            <p>
              Had we recognised this earlier, we might have concluded this
              business lacked venture-scale potential, or we could have examined
              how to modify our approach.

                liked, printed them out, and mailed them to the landowners.

              Paul Graham has an essay where he says the most efficient question
              to ask founders is “What have you learnt from users?”. One problem
              this question would have exposed if we’d asked it was that we
              hadn’t spoken to the people using Attract and who would develop
              their land with us. The people we were speaking to and learning
              about planning and development from weren’t our actual users. This
              meant we couldn’t begin testing our product’s commercial traction
              by asking if a user would pay for it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although we erred by not getting relevant user feedback while we
              had months of savings, the focus in the latter part of the raise
              to build a business plan was probably correct. We were working on
              Tract unpaid. As the deadline to raise money approached, our focus
              was (not unreasonably) on getting the funding to survive.
            </p>
            <p>
              These weeks were a success: we raised capital in a tough situation
              when the alternative was to shut down and get jobs. However, we
              had backed ourselves into a corner, not taking advantage of the
              previous time to run a rigorous market and product-discovery
              process.

              The Fundraise (January 2024 - April 2024)
            </h3>

            <p>
              Since raising capital, we've learned our fundraising experience
              was unusual. VCs operate with a fundamental asymmetry: it costs
              them virtually nothing to stay in touch with a company without
              investing, but missing the next unicorn can be catastrophic to
              their portfolio returns. This creates a dynamic where they'll meet
              hundreds of companies annually, rarely delivering outright
              rejections.
            </p>

            <p>
              Contrary to the "VCs never say no" stereotype, most were capable
              of clear passes: "not a market we know enough about" or "we're not
              convinced about this aspect of the pitch." The key insight is
              this: if a VC sees potential, they move quickly. If you're stuck
              in a holding pattern of positive but non-committal feedback, their
              current position is likely "no"—they're leaving the door open in
              case you gain traction or pivot to something more compelling.
            </p>

            <p>
              We found ourselves in this holding pattern. One VC was interested
              but nervous about leading the round, while at another, the lead
              partner wanted to write an angel check but wouldn't commit to
              funding institutionally. This created a frustrating cycle of
              meetings yielding positive feedback followed by requests for "just
              one more" spreadsheet or one-pager to clarify something. During
              this period, we worked to integrate early Attract usage data into
              our narrative about targeting small sites as land promoters.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through delicate back-channeling between the two firms, we got
              them as joint leads, with five angels joining the round. We then
              experienced that classic founder moment where, after securing a
              term sheet, several other firms expressed interest.
            </p>

            <p>
              The process from term sheet to closing took over a month. Despite
              being a straightforward priced round, we had to pay both teams
              lawyers to negotiate minor details. In San Francisco, a deal this
              size would have been done with a quick SAFE note, so it was
              frustrating to spend £25,000 out of the £744,000 we raised on
              legal fees.

              whereas nearly every warm intro was happy to talk to us. These
              came from former colleagues who became investors or had startups
              and introduced us to their VCs. People want to make and receive
              introductions. So, assuming you make a good impression, feel free
              to ask for help. If they don’t feel comfortable (maybe they don’t
              they don’t feel comfortable (maybe they don’t know the person
              well, or they’ve recently taken up a lot of their time, or they’re
              busy) they will politely explain why.

              Unless you have hockey-stick growth and a surplus of investor

              <strong>Try to raise early rounds on a SAFE/ASA</strong> - even in
              tranches, even if it means accepting less cash or a lower
              valuation, even if it complicates your cap table. Despite capping
              legal fees at each stage, we spent £25,000 on lawyers – capital
              that should have gone toward building our business. We waited over
              a month for the money and were distracted figuring out legal
              terms.

              <strong>Not every business suits VC</strong> - If you’re
              interested in technology or startups, you’ll hear lots from
              venture capitalists. This is partly because they engage in content
              marketing and thought leadership to attract dealflow and partly
              because being a VC requires optimism and interest in the future.
              So their interests will overlap with yours as a startup founder.
              But before you raise money from them, consider if your business
              fits their financing model. Venture investments follow a power law
              model. Venture investments follow a power law where a few pay off
              so well that they cover the others that go to ~zero.
            </p>

            <p>
              A good pitch to a VC should acknowledge the risks of the company
              failing, but not eliminate them. The focus should be on the huge
              opportunity if you overcome them. For decades, software companies
              fit this model. There’s a risky startup stage,but if a company
              survives, they can build moats through network effects (the most
              useful platform is the most popular) and switching costs
              (migrating data and workflows to a new system is hard).
            </p>

            <p>
              Not every business is like this. In real estate, you may have a
              thesis about where demand is going. You may make speculative
              acquisitions or invest in site improvements before selling. It’s
              unlikely these bets will pay off 100 to 1000x like the best
              venture investments. However, a good thesis and execution can
              generate an internal rate of return of 10 to 20% - more than
              keeping pace with a VC fund’s aggregate return. There are
              investors interested in these opportunities but they make less
              noise than VCs. They are often family offices, and may be the LPs
              of venture funds.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some companies try to balance being a high-risk bet with high per
              deal costs by raising money from VCs for an operating company and
              property investors for a property company. The former bet on the
              company growing to process many deals,while the latter bet on the
              success rate of those deals. These complex deals require careful
              alignment of everyone’s incentives.

            </h3>

            <p>
              Marketing to landowners proved difficult. An appraisal tool for
              farmers doesn't go viral. We identified things like niche Google
              searches e.g. specific DEFRA forms with low ad competition, but a
              few thousand pounds of ad spend generated minimal activity.
            </p>

            <p>
              The challenge: landowners might pay hundreds for an appraisal, but
              rarely need one. Identifying and reaching them at their moment of
              need was nearly impossible.
            </p>

            <p>We made two critical mistakes:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                We spent three months rebuilding the Appraisal tool before
                contacting landowners who had submitted sites through our MVP.
                These existing submissions represented our only real users, yet
                we failed to nurture these relationships or learn from them
                immediately. We didn't take them seriously enough as potential
                customers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Second, we failed to understand the basic economics of land
                agency—the business we were trying to replace. When we spoke
                with established land agents, we discovered uncomfortable
                truths: they completed very few referrals, and each took 18-24
                months minimum to process.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <blockquote class="comment">

                Such an own-goal. So easy to avoid. And something that everybody

                assumptions.

            <p>
              Land agents are fragmented: many serve small geographic areas. A
              birds-eye view of this market suggests you can roll it up for
              economies of scale. We liked this logic, so we pursued it.
            </p>

            <p>
              We didn’t consider if the fragmentation was a feature rather than
              a bug. Each agent spends a lot of time building the social
              infrastructure – going to fairs, drinking in pubs, befriending the
              parish council – needed for these deals. Landowners are a small-c
              conservative customer, and they don’t respond well to audacious
              pitches and fast timetables. These deals take 18-24 months because
              these are emotional decisions, not scalable ones.
            </p>

            <p>
              Two or three phone calls could have revealed this reality and
              neutered any delusions about revolutionising this industry.
              Instead, we wasted six months—three building software and three
              wondering why nobody used it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Compounding these errors, we hired extra marketing and operations
              staff based on flawed assumptions:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                We had no evidence that more marketing would help without a
                proven customer acquisition strategy;
              </li>
              <li>
                We weren't constrained enough to justify these hires—we should
                have pushed ourselves harder first.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              We found a few promising sites where the landowner was eager to
              collaborate. However, further investigation revealed unique
              complications that would require bespoke work taking months to
              resolve before we even got onto the steps we aspired to automate.
              This wasn’t a deal breaker, but it would mean using nearly all our
              capital to bet on four sites over the next couple of years. If we
              got them through the system, we could make enough money to repeat
              the process at a greater scale. However, it was also possible that
              we wouldn’t. We would have spent two years working as conventional
              land promoters, which others could do better.
            </p>

            <p>
              As we considered the sites we had and ways to increase
              submissions, we explored higher leverage ways to use our skills.
              What was our comparative advantage? We could build software. So we
              dove back into the murky world of pure proptech.

              Interlude: The Grid (December 2024)
            </h3>

            <p>
              The state of our electricity grid is an important story. Whenever
              we met a developer, residential, commercial, or energy, the
              uncertainty about how long they would be stuck in the
              interconnection queue and how much they might pay in first or
              second comer charges would come up. Delays or unexpected charges
              could run into the millions.
            </p>

            <p>
              We lack good tools for modelling the grid. At the time of writing
              the

              thinks that Didcot is on the Isle of Wight, and Sizewell B is in
              Scotland. If you want to build something that will draw from or
              inject significant power into the grid, you need to know:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>What is the current capacity around your proposed site?</li>
              <li>What will the capacity be in the next few years?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              We already had a map with layers like power line and substation
              locations, voltages, and official headroom capacity.
            </p>

            <p>
              DNOs publish their actual headroom monthly in tables called the
              embedded capacity register. It wouldn’t be hard to add that.
            </p>

            <p>
              We were scraping planning applications to build a model of future
              generation and demand growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the year’s end, we explored whether this was a worthwhile pivot
              opportunity. We found a couple of developers who hired
              consultancies to build internal tools at great expense. We found a
              couple of start-ups whose demos didn’t justify the huge prices for
              features on our roadmap. We had exciting conversations with one
              energy developer about a design partnership. They wanted a
              platform to find companies in the connection queue open to selling
              their spot.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our idea was speculative, requiring us to negotiate deals in an
              unfamiliar industry. Meanwhile, we were making progress with the
              Editor project. So we shelved this idea.
